This is the project for software engineering developing Air ticketing system in which the user is able to search for a flight without login and also with login. New users can register using the signup page and login using the same email id ad password which was used during registration. After login, the user can search for a flight and update their personal information. This is implemented in the Sprint 1. Further, booking of the flights will be done in sprint 2.

The project is developed in the Netbeans 12.1 IDE using java development kit 14. JFrame is used to implement the project. 

To run the project, make sure that "MySQL-jdbc" .jar files, which is driver for sql connection with java are added to library. Also, "jcalendar-1.4.jar" must be added to the project library. If these files are not added automatically, it can be found in the main AirTicketingSystem folder. Add them from that path and then run project.

Also, run sql files which are added in the folder. these files are to create table in the local server.
